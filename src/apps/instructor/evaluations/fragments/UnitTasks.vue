            Task: Laser Cutting</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> make lasercutter test part(s), varying slot dimensions using parametric functions, testing your laser kerf & cutting settings (group project) </li>
            <li> cut something on the vinylcutter </li>
            <li> design, make, and document a parametric press-fit construction kit, accounting for the lasercutter kerf, which can be assembled in multiple ways </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Task: Vinyl Cutting</h4>
        <p>There is no specific project that is focussed on this very useful tool. There are a range of ways you might utilise it throughout the programme, or your local instructor may set a specific project. You might make:
            <ul>
                <li>stickers</li>
    
                <li>flexible circuit boards</li>
    
                <li>a textured surface/relief pattern</li>
    
                <li>screenprint resists/stencils
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Ensure that you have used it in some way during this time and met the objectives below.</p>
